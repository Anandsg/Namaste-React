## What is `Microservice`?

A `microservice` is a software architectural style and approach to developing applications as a collection of small, independent, and loosely coupled services. Each microservice represents a specific, self-contained functionality of an application and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. Microservices are designed to work together to form a complete application, with each service responsible for a specific business capability.

- Benefits of Microservices:
  - Flexible Scaling
  - Easy Deployment
  - Technological Freedom
  - Reusable Code
  - Resilience

## What is `Monolith architecture`?

Monolith architecture, also known as the monolithic architecture pattern, is a traditional software architectural style in which all the components and functions of an application are tightly integrated and packaged as a single, unified codebase. In a monolithic architecture, the entire application, including the user interface, business logic, and data access layer, is typically built and deployed as a single unit.

## What is the difference between `Monolith and Microservice`?

- `Monolith:` In a monolithic architecture, the entire application is developed as a single, tightly integrated codebase. All components, modules, and functions are part of the same application, and they typically share the same database.

- `Microservices:` Microservices are inherently modular. Each service is self-contained, meaning changes to one service don't affect others. This promotes independent development and deployment, making it easier to scale and maintain.

## Why do we need a `useEffect` Hook?

`useEffect` Hook is javascript function provided by react. The useEffect Hook allows you to eliminate `side effects` in your components. Some examples of side effects are: fetching API data, directly updating the DOM, and setting up subscriptions or timers, etc can be lead to unwarranted side-effects. useEffect accepts two arguments, a callback function and a dependency array. The second argument is optional.

```
useEffect(() => {}, [])
```

The `() => {}` is callback function and `[]` is called a empty dependency array.
If anything that we pass (suppose currentState) inside the `[]` it trigger the callback function and changes the state of the application.

```
useEffect(() => {
    setCurrentState("true");
}, [currentState])
```

If we do not pass empty dependency array then the useEffect runs everytime when the UI is rendered.

```
useEffect(() => {})
```

## What is `Optional Chaining`?

`Optional Chaining` (`?.`) operator accesses an object's property or calls a function. If the object accessed or function called is `undefined or null` , it returns `undefined` instead of throwing an error.
`Optional Chaining` (`?.`) is good way of accessing the object keys, it prevents the application from being crashed if the key that we are trying to access is not present. If the key is not present then instead of a throwing key error, it returns `undefined`.

## What is `Shimmer UI`?

`Shimmer UI` resembles the page's actual UI, so users will understand how quickly the web or mobile app will load even before the content has shown up. It gives people an idea of what's about to come and what's happening (while UI currently loading) when a page full of content/data takes more than 3 - 5 seconds to load.
Shimmer UI is a great way for loading the applications. Instead of showing a loading circle we can design a shimmer UI for our application that is good for user experience.

## What is the difference between `JS expression and JS statement`?

A `JS expression` returns a value that we use in the application. for example:

```
1 + 2 // expresses
"foo".toUpperCase() // expresses 'FOO'
console.log(2) // logs '2'
isTrue ? true : false // returns us a true or false value based on isTrue value
```

A `JS statement`, does not return a value. for example:

```
let x; // variable declaration
if () { } // if condition
```

If we want to use `JS expression` in JSX, we have to wrap in `{/* expression slot */}` and if we want to use `JS statement` in JSX, we have to wrap in `{(/* statement slot */)}`;

## What is `Conditional Rendering`? explain with a code example.

`Conditional rendering` in React works the same way conditions work in `JavaScript`. Use JavaScript operators like `if` or the `conditional operator` to create elements representing the current state, and let React update the UI to match them. for example:

```
// Using Ternary operator as a shorthand way or writing an if-else statement
{isLoggedIn ? (return <UserGreeting />) : (return <GuestGreeting />)};
// Using an ifâ€¦else Statement
{
  (if (isLoggedIn) {
    return <UserGreeting />;
  }else {
    return <GuestGreeting />;
  })
}
// Using Logical &&
{isLoggedIn && <button>Logout</button>}
```

## Q: What is `CORS`?

A: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should permit loading resources.
CORS defines a way in which a browser and server can interact to determine whether it is safe to allow the cross-origin request.

## What is `async and await`?

`Async`: It simply allows us to write promises-based code as if it was synchronous and it checks that we are not breaking the execution thread. It operates asynchronously via the event loop. Async functions will always return a promise. It makes sure that a promise is returned and if it is not returned then JavaScript automatically wraps it in a promise which is resolved with its value.

`Await`: Await function is used to wait for the promise. It could be used within the `async` block only. It makes the code wait until the promise returns a result. It only makes the async block wait.
for example:

```
// async function getRestaurant to fetch Swiggy API data
  async function getRestaurants() {
    const data = await fetch(
      "Swiggy_API_URL"
    );
    const json = await data.json();
    // we get the Swiggy API data in json format
    console.log(json);
  }
```

## What is the use of `const json = await data.json()`; in `getRestaurants()`?

The `data` object, returned by the `await fetch()`, is a generic placeholder for multiple data formats.
so we can extract the `JSON object` from a `fetch` response by using `await data.json()`.
`data.json()` is a method on the data object that lets you extract a `JSON object` from the data or response. The method returns a promise because we have used `await` keyword.
so `data.json()` returns a promise resolved to a `JSON object`.

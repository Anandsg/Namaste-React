## Difference between a `Library and Framework`

A **library** is a collection of pre-written code that developers can use to perform specific tasks. A **framework**, on the other hand, provides a broader structure and guidelines for building applications. While libraries offer more flexibility, frameworks impose a specific architecture.

## What is `CDN`? Why do we use it?

A **CDN (Content Delivery Network)** is a network of distributed servers that deliver web content to users based on their geographical location. CDNs improve page load times and reduce server load by caching content closer to users, resulting in a faster and more reliable browsing experience.

## Why is `React` known as React?

## Difference between `react.development.js` and `react.production.js` files via CDN

The `react.development.js` file provides a larger file size with additional development-friendly features like debugging messages. The `react.production.js` file, on the other hand, is optimized for production environments, resulting in a smaller file size and improved performance.

## What is `async and defer`?

The `async` and `defer` attributes in the script tag control how scripts are loaded and executed on a web page. **Async** loads the script asynchronously without blocking the rendering of the page. **Defer** also loads the script asynchronously but ensures the script is executed in the order they appear in the HTML document after the page is fully parsed.
